    <title>Hints and Mnemonics for Flashcards</title>
  </head>
  <body style="margin:30px;">
  
    <p>There are different kinds of hints you can provide for each flashcard. It the Hint button is greyed out, that means there is no hint for that flashcard. Here are the meanings of the different types of hints.</p>
    <p>
    <b>General</b><br>
    Anything to prod the memory for the specific question. eg. For a question of "What fish goes best with a cream cheese bagel?" where the answer is "lox", the general hint might be "rhymes with fox".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sentence Mnemonic</b><br>
    A sentence whose first letter of each word represents a list of other words with the same first letter. eg. "<u>P</u>lease <u>E</u>xcuse <u>M</u>y <u>D</u>ear <u>A</u>unt <u>S</u>ally" is for memorizing the order of math operations; <u>P</u>arentheses, <u>E</u>xponents, <u>M</u>ultiply, <u>D</u>ivide, <u>A</u>dd, <u>S</u>ubtract
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Rhyme Mnemonic</b><br>
    A sentence that rhymes sticks in the brain better than a dry fact. eg. To remember Alaska and Hawaii's statehood; "'59 was the date when Alaska and Hawaii became new states".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Word Mnemonic</b><br>
    An acronym that spells a real word. eg. HOMES for memorizing the Great Lakes; <u>H</u>uron Lake, <u>O</u>ntario Lake, <u>M</u>ichigan Lake, <u>E</u>rie Lake, <u>S</u>uperior Lake
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Name Acronym</b><br>
    The first letter of each word from a list to memorize and form it into a person's name. eg. Roy G. Biv for the colors of the rainbow; red, orange, yellow, green, blue indigo, violet. Using the name in a sentence might create a context that makes it more memorable. For example, "Roy G. Biv is a colorful man".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Simple Acronym</b><br>
    The first letter of each word without regard to forming a rhyme, sentence or word. This is the weakest mnemonic, but perhaps better than nothing and may actually work as a way to jog the memory. eg. "T-C-CG" to represent "transparency, collaboration, and common goals". Note the use of hyphens to separate words and word phrases. ("CG" in "T-C-CG" is not separated by a hyphen because it represents the phrase "common goals" whereas the single words are separated by hyphens. Again, I don't think memorizing "T-C-CG" is easier than memorizing the words, but "T-C-CG" may help jog the memory when using the flashcards.<br />
    Consider the acronym for the development lifecycle, "PCBTRDOM" - plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor. This particular list is an ordered sequence that must be maintained in the acronym. When the order doesn't matter, try to make the acronym alliterative or more memorable. eg. "PC B MORDT" might be more memorable, but since order is important for the development lifecycle, you can't do that.

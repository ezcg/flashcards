Meters divided by seconds"},{"cardId":52,"question":"What is the definition of acceleration?","answer":"The rate of change of velocity. Acceleration (a) is the change in velocity (Δv) over the change in time (Δt), represented by the equation a = Δv/Δt."},{"cardId":46,"question":"At Earth's surface the acceleration of gravity is about","answer":"9.8 metres (32 feet) per second per second."},{"cardId":49,"question":"What is the meaning of 32 feet per second per second?","answer":"32 feet per second per second is acceleration. A body accelerating at a rate of 32 feet/second means the velocity it's moving at is increasing by 32 feet per second every second.  "},{"cardId":57,"question":"Mass is ","answer":"both a property of a physical body and a measure of its resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied."},{"cardId":56,"question":"Weight is ","answer":"the mass of an object times the gravitational acceleration. W = m * g"},{"cardId":48,"question":"What is the cause of gravity?","answer":"Albert Einstein described gravity not as a force, but as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the uneven distribution of mass."},{"cardId":53,"question":"Vector quantity has both","answer":"both magnitude and direction. For example, displacement, force, torque, momentum, acceleration, velocity, etc."},{"cardId":54,"question":"A quantity which does not depend on direction is called ","answer":"a scalar quantity. Scalar quantities have only a magnitude. Examples; volume, density, speed, energy, mass, and time."},{"cardId":47,"question":"Newton's law of universal gravitation states that","answer":"every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers."},{"cardId":55,"question":"What is the formula for the force of gravity in Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation?","answer":"F = (G x m1 x m2) / r2\nF = force of gravity\nG = gravitational constant\nm1 = mass of the first object (lets assume it’s of the massive one)\nm2 = mass of the second object (lets assume it’s of the smaller one)\nr = the separation between the two masses"}]}

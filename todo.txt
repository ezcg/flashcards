Make more noticable:
    make some messaging disappear after time limit. eg. 'Updated' should disappear after 10 seconds.
    after update card button pushed, 'Updated' message needs better spacing and bolder
    most recently added card appears first in list when editing. See what you just added without having to scroll down
    make "You've made 20 flashcards which is the maximum number of flashcards you can have per tutorial. Well done!" more visible
    what to do about cloudfront caching - don't cache .json files?
    make Question visibly different from Answer in edit mode

deploy to elasticbeanstalk with database automatically initialized if it isn't already
auto backup of db


Tutorial:
- beanstalk, no ssl, db tied to stack, no ssl for admin and load balancer for admin
- beanstalk, ssl and cloudfrount, db tied to stack, load balancer for admin with ssl
- beanstalk, ssl for all, db not tied to stack

Nice to have:
make categories managed via ui and writable as json to s3
make user access level (roles) managed via ui
for code dev purposes, create dev s3 bucket that doesn't require cloudfrount and update 's3Url' in flashcardsapp/src/configs.js. accesible via mobile phone
